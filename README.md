# Xiaoyue's dissertation
The dissertaion is composed of three main chapters (each being a paper) and a geneneral introduction and discussion.
* Chapter 1: Introduction
* Chapter 2: An analysis of decision under risk in mice, rats and humans
* Chapter 3: Frontal but not parietal cortex is required for decisions under risk
* Chapter 4: A rodent paradigm for studying perceptual decisions under asymmetric reward
* Chapter 5: Discussion

* The general discussion is a major work in progress. There are many points I wish to address and discuss, especially concerning the role of the FOF and PPC in decision-making and their roles in general. The argument will be formulated but it will take some time, given how wide and complex the literature is.
